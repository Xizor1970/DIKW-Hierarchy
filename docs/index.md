There is no wisdom without knowledge,there is no knowledge without information, and there is no information withoutdata. Do you agree or disagree with this view? Justify your stand.****Justification:** It was in his treatise, *Discourse of Methods,* where ReneDescartes wrote, *“je pense, donc je suis”* (I think, therefore I am)(Descartes, 1637). We can all agree that it is probably the wisest thing anyFrenchman has ever written. But, where does such wisdom come from? Surely, itcan’t exist in a vacuum by itself. Monsieur Descartes was, at the time, workinghis way through an existential crisis and was probably unaware of the generalwisdom he was divulging. Where did his wisdom originated from? Surely, it camefrom his thoughts, which was based on his knowledge of life, which he gainedthrough experiences. All his experiences were stored as information in his mindby billions of neurons and synapses.With that view of Rene’s mind, let’s start at the top of the DIKW hierarchy andask the question - can wisdom exist without knowledge? Personally, I battle tofathom such a situation. How can one make wise decisions without knowinganything? I don’t believe we can. The same goes for knowledge – can we beknowledgeable about something without holding any information on the subject?Again, I don’t think this is possible.The DIKW hierarchy succeeds in explaining the idea that there exists a naturalorder to the flow of knowledge. The structure of the hierarchy, presented as apyramid, unashamedly spells out the concept that there is a progression fromdata to information to knowledge and eventually to wisdom (Rowley, 2007).The pyramid structure also suggests that there is a natural ratio that existsbetween each of the layers of the pyramid and that the further we traverse upthe hierarchy the scarcer the next entity of the hierarchy becomes. Thisresonates well with the well-known “Maslow’s hierarchy of needs” (“Maslow’shierarchy of needs,” 2019). Although, I’m sure the French would argue that *lapetite mort* and a few good baguettes are way more important than data.**According to the DIKW hierarchy, it is estimated that on average about 40 percent of the human mind consists of data, 30 per cent information, 20 per centknowledge, 10 per cent understanding, and very minimal wisdom. That is, there isless information than data, less knowledge than information, and less wisdomthan knowledge. This is why the hierarchy is also called the knowledge pyramid.Do you agree or disagree with this view? Can we have more information than dataor more knowledge than information? Justify your stand****Justification:** At best, I would argue, that we can only *assume* the humanmind holds data, information, knowledge and wisdom in the proportions assuggested. I say this because, we still don’t know exactly how the human mindworks (Gorman, 2018). The initially mentioned assumption stems from ourobservation from the natural world around us. For instance, we witness enormousamounts of data being stored in databases. We can measure the volume of datathat is stored and the rate at which it flows in and out of our storage devices.This ability makes data a very tangible object and therefore we accept it as thebase layer of the pyramid structure; and not necessarily because it is theabsolute truth but, rather because it is a comfortable proposition.The next layer, information, is measurable as suggested by information theory.Information theory utilises *entropy* to quantify the amount of uncertaintyinvolved in the value of a random variable (Shannon, 1948), which suggests the*shannon (symbol:Sh)* measure. Highly organised data, such as found indatabases, contains low entropy and therefore a high level of information.The next two levels of the hierarchy, knowledge and wisdom, have no quantifiabledimensions by which they can be measured. For instance, we can only refer to theamount of knowledge as a general quantity, e.g. little, average or vast amountsof knowledge. The same goes for wisdom. I think it is due to this humaninability to parameterize knowledge and wisdom vs. the quantifiable *gigabyte*and s*hannon* that makes us naturally assume that wisdom is less than knowledge,which in turn is less than information, which in turn is less than data. TheDIKW hierarchy, with its pyramid shape, enforces this idea and makes it veryeasy to accept.**Even though there are some debates on the hierarchy, it is a‘taken-forgranted’ notion in data science and information science. What arepossible criticisms and potential drawbacks of the hierarchy (including bothyour own opinion and an analysis of what you find in research literature)?Investigate and research criticism and potential drawbacks of the hierarchy, andlist three to five (3-5) of them with justification****Justification:** To state it blandly, the DIKW wisdom hierarchy is just notcomprehensive enough. Some authors criticize the pyramid structure of the DIKWand state that it is too simplistic. They argue that a more complex structure,such as a *tetradian*, could better describe the hierarchy (Graves, 2012). Itmight sound a bit *avant-*garde but, by suggesting a more complex geometricalstructure, some authors create additional dimensional space wherein they canintroduce new augmented ideas to the DIKW hierarchy. For instance,*context,* which frames information; *connections*, which links data items andcontext; *purpose,* which serves as a structure to give guidance towards wisdom(Graves, 2012).At best, I would agree that the DIKW hierarchy is a *general* portrayal ofknowledge flow and serves well as a blanket theory that places data,information, knowledge and wisdom in an acceptable and easily consumable humancontext. In other words, the DIKW hierarchy resonates well with humans becauseit is easily consumable in its current, simplistic portrayal.The DIKW concept also facilitates and creates awareness about the ideas thatflows around and from the concept. For instance, it entices us to look deeperinto ideas such as meaning, insight, informativeness, principles, believes andintent. The latter mentioned ideas can be grouped into even higher abstractideas such as strategy, game theory and eventually wisdom itself. Hence, thefrustration of contemporary thought leaders with the current restrictive pyramidstructure.Finally, I think that the DIKW hierarchy lends itself well to form an elegantsynergy with the bi-directional, temporal flow of the chronological order of theindividual concepts in the hierarchy, i.e. data facilitates information, whichfacilitates knowledge, which facilitates wisdom, which flows back intoknowledge, which creates information and eventually is stores as data. Maybe anew geometrical shape is required to incorporate many of the additional,well-intended ideas into a new DIKW hierarchy - DIKW Mk II?**There are several types of data/information systems: transaction processingsystems, management information systems, data warehouses, decision supportsystems, and expert systems. Map the DIWK hierarchy to these types ofinformation systems and justify your mapping. For instance, you might start yourresponse with ’Data warehouses are mapped to the information level in thehierarchy, because they are…’, or ’Data warehouses are mapped to the knowledgelevel in the hierarchy due to…’****Justification:** At the most fundamental level we can map any system, whichhas the capability to store, process and move data, to the data layer in theDIKW hierarchy. Transaction processing systems facilitate the movement of highlyorganized and structured data and can therefore be mapped to the informationlevel in the DIKW hierarchy.With the idea that information can be gathered from data once data is orderedand contextualise (Shannon, 1948), we can assume that databases and datawarehouses are mapped to both the data and information layers in the DIKWhierarchy. However, data warehouses are designed around subjects (Inmon, 2000),which means that the information they contain offers a knowledge base to itsusers (“KMS-Techopedia,” 2019). Although one can argue that *subject orientated*information constitutes explicit knowledge (e.g. business intelligence), one canalso argue that *contextualized* information carries implied knowledge.Knowledge management systems should encompass both explicit and impliedknowledge and therefore, we can also map data warehouses to the knowledge levelof the DIKW hierarchy.Decision support systems are information systems that support businesses indecision-making activities (“Decision support system,” 2019). This means thathighly focussed knowledge is presented and suggested to decision makers bydecision support systems. Therefore, we can say that decision support systemscan be mapped to the knowledge level of the DIKW Hierarchy.Expert systems is said to utilises artificial intelligence to mimic humanintelligence (“Expert system,” 2019). Expert systems function on two subsystems,inference engine and a knowledge base (“Expert system,” 2019). It is stated thatexpert systems solve problems by “reasoning” through bodies of knowledge. I’mstill a sceptic of this idea and I would, at most, agree that these expertsystems could only mimic the process of reasoning, Non-the-less, besides humans,expert systems are probably the closest entity which we can map to the wisdomlevel of the DIKW hierarchy.**Ackoff stated that “From all this I infer that although we are able to developcomputerized information-, knowledge- and understanding-generating systems, wewill never be able to generate wisdom by such systems.” Do you agree or disagreewith Ackoff’s statement? Justify your stand.****Justification:** In order to understand why wisdom cannot be generated bymachines, we need to understand what wisdom is. Wisdom is an abstract concept,which is non-quantifiable. At best we can categorize wisdom as either good orbad. By portraying something as good or bad we inevitably drag morality into theequation, which in turn is driven by principles and believes.According to the DIKW hierarchy we reach wisdom once we transcend knowledge. Inmy view an intermediary step is needed to complete this jump from knowledge towisdom; and that step is *opinion*. Once a certain level and amount of knowledgehas been attained regarding a *gestalt*, an opinion can be formed. Although theopinion of a *corpus* arises from knowledge it is tempered by the overarchingprinciples and believes of the *corpus*. Once an opinion has been formed, itinevitably leads to intent. Without an opinion there could be no intent, andintent is what drives strategy. Although opinion is not *fact* (“Opinion,”2019), it is the intermediary step required to get to wisdom, which isinfluenced by believe, which is also not *fact.* Once we leave the realm of*fact* (data, information, knowledge), we enter a sphere of abstract thought inwhich wisdom resides.All the above concepts, ideas and entities form the inner workings of wisdom.Going from knowledge to wisdom is an entirely human endeavour. Machines, Idoubt, will ever have the capability to foster wisdom as based on the elementssuggested above. I want to go further and state that wisdom is based on lifeexperience, the ability to reflect, to project and to interpolate. No machinewill ever possess the ability to reflect upon its life events. To a machinethose events are only raw bits of data.References----------Decision support system. (2019). In *Wikipedia*.
